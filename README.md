# unFudgeWriting
A writing software targeted for the engineer in you. I am tired of the constant requirement of multiple softwares to write and proofread mathematical papers, and when math and computer simulations coinside my life turns into a cyle of change equatios, redo simulations, and remake plots. I have searched far and wide; Softwares that focus on UX writing features such as drag and drop placement of sections, preview, typewriter views are not suitable for research writing, and softwares that are for research writing don't bother with their UI. unFudgeWriting aims to make the academic writing process, especially of those who write academic papers containing equations, graphics and plot plesent and enjoyable.
